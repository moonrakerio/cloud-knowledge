##[Ubuntu BootStack] (https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/openstack/managed-cloud)
The BootStack service gives you an OpenStack private cloud, running on your hardware,
in your choice of datacentre with Canonical responsible for design, deployment and
availability. Weâ€™ll even train your team and, when it suits you, hand over operational
control.
