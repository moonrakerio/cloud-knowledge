[Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)] (https://aws.amazon.com/vpc/?nc2=h_m1)
Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a logically isolated
section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud where you can launch AWS resources in
a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking
environment, including selection of your own IP address range, creation of subnets, and
configuration of route tables and network gateways.
