## [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), provides developers and IT teams with secure,
durable, highly-scalable cloud storage. Amazon S3 is easy to use object storage, with a
simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on
the web. With Amazon S3, you pay only for the storage you actually use. There is no
minimum fee and no setup cost.

Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for
different use cases including Amazon S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of
frequently accessed data, Amazon S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (Standard - IA) for
long-lived, but less frequently accessed data, and Amazon Glacier for long-term archive.
Amazon S3 also offers configurable lifecycle policies for managing your data throughout
its lifecycle. Once a policy is set, your data will automatically migrate to the most
appropriate storage class without any changes to your applications.

Amazon S3 can be used alone or together with other AWS services such as
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM),
as well as cloud data migration services and gateways for initial or ongoing data
ingestion. Amazon S3 provides cost-effective object storage for a wide variety of use
cases including backup and recovery, nearline archive, big data analytics, disaster
recovery, cloud applications, and content distribution.
