##[Ubuntu OpenStack] (https://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/openstack)
Canonical’s Ubuntu OS is the OS of choice for 55% of the world’s OpenStack deployments,
so it’s safe to say that the folks at Canonical know a thing or two about OpenStack.
Ubuntu OpenStack is as close to the OpenStack source code as possible and is always
based on the latest release, so it is ideal for those who are on the leading edge, and
favour speed and innovation rather than stability. Ubuntu offers their distribution in a
number of ways including DIY, custom-built clouds, and fully managed clouds. Ubuntu
OpenStack is deployed with and integrated with MAAS and Juju – their bare-metal
deployment and service design & orchestration tools. All together – the three provide
you with the ability to deploy, scale and manage everything from bare-metal all the way
up to the application layer.

* Focus on speed and innovation
* Close to source code, latest version
* Fully managed version available
