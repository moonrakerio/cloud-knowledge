##[OpenStack] (http://www.openstack.org/)
OpenStack is a well-supported open source project that provides all of the tools required 
to build a private or public cloud. OpenStack controls large pools of compute, storage, 
and networking resources throughout a datacenter, all managed through a dashboard that 
gives administrators control while empowering their users to provision resources through 
a web interface.
